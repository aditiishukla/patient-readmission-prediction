Developed a machine learning project to predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted in the hospital, using structured clinical data. This project uses supervised learning algorithm, Logistic Regression to analyze patterns and predict the likelihood of readmission. The goal is to assist healthcare providers in making data-driven decisions, improve patient care, and reduce unnecessary hospital stays. The repository contains the complete Jupyter Notebook with all the data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualizations to support the analysis.
